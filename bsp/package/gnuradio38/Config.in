	  GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development
	  toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement
	  software radios. It can be used with readily-available
	  low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined
	  radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like
	  environment. It is widely used in hobbyist, academic and
	  commercial environments to support both wireless
	  communications research and real-world radio systems.
